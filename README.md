## Background
The Cancer Network Information System (CNIS) is the primary data repository for all aspects of cancer diagnosis and treatment. This system is the main source of data when evaluating patientsâ€™ cancer diagnosis and care, the wait times they encounter and informs cancer registration, providing comprehensive records of a patient's cancer care from diagnosis through to progression (Morgan, 2023).
CaNISC has been widely used across Wales by all Health Boards and Trusts, hospices, and other organisations that deliver cancer care. It enables multiple organisations to record and share information about a patient's diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up care.

## Purpose 
CNIS is a data source that can be analyzed via the SAIL Databank, however, its use is relatively low. 
This data explained aims to provide an overview of the CNIS datasource, showcase its contents and what it can be used for in Cancer Research. 

## Data Structure 
Markdown containing all SQL and R code used to generate insights published in the data explained. 

## Funding 
This project was funded by the Cancer Research Strategy for Wales (CReSt) catalytic funding (HCRW) and the Cancer Trusted Research Environment Project (Roche).
